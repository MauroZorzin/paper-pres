      "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of corns, oats, carrots and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys five 4-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 5-kg bags. Corns are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty two 38-kg packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the corns, so he buys nineteen 16-kg sacks. If his farm truck can carry 100 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
